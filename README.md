# QA Integration Testing for Frontend and Backend Services

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive QA testing setup for verifying the integration between a frontend and backend service. The objective of this task was to ensure that the frontend can successfully communicate with the backend, returning the expected results when the user interacts with the application.

## Technologies Used

- **Kubernetes**: For container orchestration.
- **Docker**: To containerize the application components.
- **Selenium**: For automating browser interactions and testing the integration.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for writing the test scripts.
- **Webdriver Manager**: For managing the browser driver binaries automatically.
  
## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine.
2. **Kubernetes**: Install and configure Minikube or another Kubernetes setup.
3. **Python**: Install Python 3.x on your system.
4. **Selenium**: Install the Selenium package via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium webdriver-manager
   ```

### Deployment

1. **Deploy the Application**: 
   - Clone the repository containing your application code.
   - Deploy the backend and frontend services on Kubernetes:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
     ```
2. **Verify Pods and Services**:
   - Check that the pods are running:
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods
     ```
   - Check that the services are created:
     ```bash
     kubectl get services
     ```

3. **Port Forwarding**:
   - Use port forwarding to access the frontend service locally:
     ```bash
     kubectl port-forward service/frontend-service 8080:80
     ```

## Testing

### Test Script

The integration test is defined in the `test_script.py` file. The script performs the following actions:

1. Sets up the Selenium WebDriver to launch a Chrome browser.
2. Navigates to the local URL of the frontend service.
3. Waits for the page to load.
4. Locates the element that displays a greeting message.
5. Compares the actual message with the expected message.
6. Outputs whether the test passed or failed.

### Running the Test

To execute the test script, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python test_script.py
```

If the test is successful, you will see a confirmation message indicating that the greeting message is displayed correctly. If any assertion fails, an error message will be printed detailing the mismatch.

## Results

During the testing process, the following was observed:

- The application returned the expected greeting message, confirming successful integration between the frontend and backend services.
- All test assertions passed without any errors, demonstrating the reliability of the communication between components.

## Conclusion

The integration testing task has been successfully completed. The frontend application is correctly receiving data from the backend service, as verified by the Selenium automation tests. Further enhancements can be made by adding more test cases and edge scenarios to ensure comprehensive coverage.
